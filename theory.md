## Description
This document explores a comprehensive theory for resolving contradictions in the Gospel accounts of Jesus, drawing from primary sources like Josephus, the Bible, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Church Fathers. It addresses 99 key questions—ranging from serious biblical scholarship issues to trivial details and artistic interpretations—using a chronological reconstruction. The theory posits deliberate alterations by early Church figures (e.g., Paul and Luke) to adapt the story for Gentiles, conflating Jesus with revolutionary figures like Judas the Galilean.

The method:  
- 60% Primary sources (Josephus, Bible, etc.)  
- 20% Alternative interpretations of contradictions  
- 10% Traditions (due to censorship)  
- 10% Logical conclusions  

This theory contradicts scholarly consensus but is judged against original sources. Full proofs span 200+ pages; this is the core narrative.

## The 99 Questions
These questions highlight inconsistencies in biblical research, historical records, and traditions. The attached theory answers them directly or by implication.

1. Why did the Church kill over a million devout Christians as Heretics? The first Priscillian, the Christian Bishop of Avila?  
2. Why are Magi, priests from a different religion, placed in the nativity story?  
3. Why does Matthew place Jesus' birth around 5 BC, while Luke places it, at least ten years later?  
4. Why does Slavonic Josephus make the Baptist an adult talking to Archelaus in 5 AD?  
5. And why does Leonardo Da Vinci paint the Baptist about 6 years older than Jesus, in the Burlington House cartoon, not six months?  
6. Why are the two babies in *The Virgin of the Rocks*, the same age, not six months different, if they are supposed to be the Baptist and Jesus?  
7. And why is it suggested that there was an apocryphal story of the two babies meeting on the ‘flight into Egypt’ when there was no such story before the painting?  
8. Why are there two statues in pride of place, either side of the altar in the church at Rennes-le-Château, Mary with one baby Jesus and Joseph with another baby Jesus?  
9. Why does Celsus and the Jewish Talmud suggest Jesus was illegitimate?  
10. Was there any significance in the fact that Jesus was born around the time that the sun was moving into the sign of Pisces, always symbolized by two fish?  
11. Why was Luke added to the Bible when he was not a witness of anything going on in Israel?  
12. Why is Christos added to Jesus’ name as if it means anointed or Messiah … yet Χριστός literally means “smeared” and there is a perfectly good Greek word, Μεσσίαν for Messiah?  
13. Why does John’s Gospel place Jesus in Jerusalem most of the time while the synoptic Gospels place him in Galilee?  
14. Why does Professor Robert Eisenman, write: ‘A great deal of trouble is taken by these writers(synoptic writers) to get Jesus to Galilee.’ But cannot explain why?  
15. And why does Peter in 10:39 state that he is a witness of everything Jesus did in Jerusalem and Judea, ignoring the fact that the synoptic Gospels have Jesus in Galilee most of the time?  
16. And why does John place the overturning of the money lenders tables at the beginning of Jesus ministry, while the synoptics place it at the end?  
17. Why do the synoptic Gospels say Jesus found Andrew and Peter by the sea of Galilee and they were fishermen… while John (Jn. 1:40) says they were found living in Judea 80 Miles from Galilee?  
18. Why did Jesus call Simon/Shimon, Kephas? Kephas in Latin is Petrus, but in English it would be Rocky, not Peter. And why does Rocky carry a sword?  
19. Why are we never told the name of the inhabitants of Bethany in the Synoptics, though John specifies it is the home of Lazarus, Mary and Martha whom Jesus loved?  
20. Why did the church invent Mary of Bethany, when, Jacapo di Voragine the 13th century Archbishop of Genoa, writing the ‘Life of Mary Magdalene’, from church records, states that ‘Mary possessed the heritage of the castle of Bethany’?  
21. Why do academics suggest John was the beloved disciple, when Jesus himself when told “the one you love is sick” says it is Lazarus? (Jn. 11:14)  
22. And why when Jesus is told that Lazarus is dead, do the disciples say, “Let us go and die with him!?  
23. Why does the Tomb used for Lazarus resurrection sound the same as the tomb used for Jesus burial, in a garden with a rolling stone door?  
24. Why do all academics comment on the triumphal entry with Jesus riding through the streets of Jerusalem with the residents cheering and laying palms, when this is not in any Gospel. All that is in Bethany not the residents.  
25. Why do all the Gospels suggest, various named ladies, can sprinkle perfume on Jesus’ feet and wipe it with their hair, and claim it is a Royal anointment?  
26. Why does Jesus say “from the days of John the Baptist until now…” as if John died some time ago?  
27. Why is it said of Jesus in Matthew that “he is not yet fifty”? Suggesting an age of around 45.  
28. Why does Josephus place the Baptist death close to the destruction of Herod’s army (36/37 AD)… several years after Jesus’ supposed crucifixion?  
29. Why is Lazarus not in the three Synoptic Gospels?  
30. Or can we say Lazarus was cut out of the synoptics as a copy of his resurrection, that was between verses 34 and 35 of Mark 10 has been found.  
31. Why was Jesus resurrection forged on to the end of Mark?  
32. How could the woman anointing Jesus feet be standing behind him?  
33. Why did Luke, who admits he is not a witness of anything, contradict the other Gospels especially John, who says it is Mary who does the anointing of Jesus’ feet, while Luke alone claims it is a sinner from the city?  
34. Why does Martha complain that she is doing all the preparations, suggesting she is doing all the preparations for the Seder meal?  
35. And why would Jesus up-sticks from Bethany and go and eat the Seder in an empty room in Jerusalem. A very unlikely scenario since there is so much preparation to do for the Seder?  
36. Why does the ‘Apostolic Church Order’ make the mistake of admitting Mary and Martha were at the Last Supper?  
37. Why is it so difficult to paint the beloved disciple leaning on Jesus bosom while he talks to Peter.  
38. Who is the second Judas at the Last Supper?  
39. The drinking of wine at the Seder meal serves a particular role, with the diners having to recline to drink. Did Jesus go against Jewish tradition in stating the wine should be drunk for a different reason?  
40. And would a Jew not be disgusted by the suggestion that he drinks wine representing blood – since they bleed all their meat?  
41. Why does Judas bring the temple guards to arrest Jesus at the Garden and not the supper room? Or are they the same place?  
42. Why is Jesus arrested by temple guards (no Romans) in the synoptics, but by a Roman cohort (800 soldiers) in John?  
43. Why does John’s Gospels say Jesus was taken to High Priest Annas first, while the synoptics to High Priest Caiaphas?  
44. Why is High Priest Joseph ben Caiaphas called High Priest Caiaphas, which would be his father?  
45. Why does Peter deny Jesus by a fire in Annas’ courtyard (John) but in Caiaphas’ courtyard in the synoptics?  
46. Why did Luke say there were two High Priests, no ifs or buts.  
47. Why does Pilate not know that the Romans have banned the Jewish authorities from killing their own people? (Jn.18:31)  
48. Why were the Sanhedrin allowed to stone Stephen if it was against Roman law? Or what punishment did they suffer?  
49. Why does the Jewish Talmud say Yeshua was stoned to death by the Sanhedrin?  
50. Why is Jesus accused of not paying taxes when he clearly states that taxes should be paid?  
51. Can it be coincidence that Barabbas’ name means son of the father, or son of God, which sounds like Jesus and that Barabbas first name is also Jesus. Jesus Barabbas? (Mat.27:17)  
52. Why is the choice between Jesus or Barabbas forgetting that there are two other robbers to be crucified.  
53. Why do the crowd shout in unison to “crucify Jesus’ when the choice of capital punishment should be Pilates not theirs and beheading is the normal.  
54. Why is there so much information about, Simon, the casual passer-by, whom the Romans forced to carry the cross? We know he came from Cyrene in Africa and that he had two sons Alexander and Rufus. Did he give an interview?  
55. Why is it suggested victims carried the Patibulum on the way to be crucified, where it is attached to the upright; when in fact a Patibulum is by definition was not a beam across the shoulders but a yoke around the neck?  
56. Why all images show Jesus with nails in his hands but experts say the nails had to be in the wrists to support the body?  
57. Why is crucifixion said to be horrific and reserved for slaves and rebels as a deterrent, yet the normal method of Capital punishment, beheading, is more horrific?  
58. Why is John 3:14 translated as if it is a prediction, when the correct translation makes it a requirement, meaning it could have already happened?  
59. Why does John say the crucifixion took place in a garden with a tomb?  
60. Why does the crucified man on the Alexamenos graffiti, have a donkey’s head?  
61. Why does Yehohanan, son of Hagakol’s heel bone have a nail, but his hands show no sign of nails?  
62. Why is the idea of death by asphyxiation on the cross repeated when we mainly breathe using the diaphragm contracting downwards not by raising of the ribs?  
63. Why is Acts 10:39 so often badly translated?  
64. Why is Acts 5:37 so muddled chronologically?  
65. Why is there no spear involved in Jesus death in the synoptic Gospels, but suddenly appears in John?  
66. Why is the Greek word, ‘stauros’ always translated as crucifix, which is wrong? Stauros means staked.  
67. What were Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus doing in the tomb with a huge quantity of antiseptic herbs, when there is no tradition of embalming in Israel?  
68. How many women come to the empty tomb? Was it one, two, or three?  
69. And was the stone door in place or open?  
70. And how many angels are there? One inside? Two outside? Or one flying down to sit on the stone door.  
71. Why like the mystery religions do Lazarus and Jesus stay in the tomb for three days?  
72. Why does Slavonic Josephus have sections that contradict the Gospels, and therefore could not be Christian insertions?  
73. Who was Chrestos mentioned by Suetonius?  
74. Why does Josephus not mention the Great Fire of Rome and the persecution by Nero of the followers of a Jew?  
75. Why does the Gospel of Barnabus suggest it was Judas Iscariot who was crucified? Could it be Judas the Sicarii as Iscariot and Sicarii have a similar root?  
76. How or possibly why, did the pages for the year 38 AD in the middle of Tacitus’ Annals go missing?  
77. Why was the Pilate quote from Tacitus not mentioned by Christians as proof for the first thousand years?  
78. Why was Tacitus statement doctored to change an ‘e’ to an ‘I’ when talking about the Christians.  
79. Why is the death of Judas the Galilean, (who Josephus blames for causing the war) missing from Josephus  
80. The expulsion of the Jews by Claudius is mentioned by Suetonius and the Bible – why is this important Jewish event not in Josephus?  
81. Why if Herod’s army, policed Galilee for the Romans, why is its destruction by King Aretas of Petra, not appear in the War book as if it is unimportant?  
82. Why has the "Testimonium Flavianum" been doctored and moved from Josephus ‘War’ book, where it has to have been, to his ‘Antiquities’ book, where if removed the text follows logically?  
83. Why, in Paul’s trial… does he deny being a Nazarene who the Romans accuse of being troublemakers, and instead calls his sect “The Way” a Pythagorean term?  
84. Why did Leonardo paint John the Baptist with one finger up indicating number one and the other hand pointing to himself?  
85. And why does this pointing finger also appear in Leonardo’s Burlington House cartoon, and again thrust in to Jesus’ face in his Last Supper painting?  
86. Why was this added to the Nicaean creed in Constantinople in 381 “He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.” Surely this is not a matter of faith, it is either a fact or not a fact?  
87. Why did the Knights Templars spit on the cross during initiation?  
88. Why did Nostradamus take on a name that is a Latinization of Notre Dame?  
89. Why did the church in 1448, change the name of the town where the Bethany family are said to have landed in Gaul?  
90. Why did Edward Gibbon write about the Great Fire of Rome: – “‘Although the genuine followers of Moses [Jews] were innocent of the fire of Rome, there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of Galileans, which was capable of the most horrid crimes.”  
91. Why is Joseph of Arimathea so often mentioned in Holy Grail stories, sometimes even being related to Knights, like Galahad?  
92. Why is someone called Maximin on the Magdalene window in Chartres Cathedral, and why is he in pride of place at the top of the window with the Magdalene in the Paris church of St Severin?  
93. Why were there so many churches built during Templar times, called Notre Dame and others dedicated to John the Baptist?  
94. Why is the explanation of the 4th Philosophy of the Jews that instigated the war, cut from the War book but appears in Antiquities.  
95. And what is the actual name of the fourth philosophy of the Jews?  
96. Why is the death of the Galileans two sons said by all academics, to be by crucifixion, when that is not the correct translation?  
97. What age could the son of Judas the Galilean be when he climbed up the fortress of Masada and beat the Romans. Surely too old if his father died in 6 AD as 18th century academics suggested?  
98. Why is there more about Judas the Galilean in Josephus, Antiquities book than in the War book, when it is claimed he was responsible for the war?  
99. Who were the people who Eusebius claimed were saying that Jesus crucifixion occurred before Pilate arrived in Judea? “For the things that they have dared to say concerning the passion of the Savoir are put into the fourth consulship of Tiberius, which occurred in the seventh year of his reign; at which time it is plain that Pilate was not yet ruling in Judea, if the testimony of Josephus is to be believed, who clearly shows in the above mentioned work (Antiquities) that Pilate was made Procurator of Judea by Tiberius in the twelfth year of his reign.’

## The Theory: Chronological Narrative
This theory reconstructs the historical Jesus using primary sources, resolving the 99 questions. It was developed before the questions list but answers nearly all.

John the Baptist was born about 14 BC, while Jesus was born around 7 BC as the sun was moving into Pisces (the two fish), creating expectations of important twins. Jesus was a twin; his twin brother was called Yehuda T’oma in Hebrew and Judas Thomas in Latin. Prof. Eisenman agrees: “The claim implicit in the name ‘Judas Thomas, is that he is a twin, ‘thoma’ in Aramaic meaning twin. The implication usually is that he is a twin of Jesus, his third brother.” In the Gospels, he is referred to as Thomas Didymus, and Judas is omitted except when he is accidentally named after Judas Iscariot leaves the Last Supper. As T’oma is Hebrew for twin and Didymus is Greek for twin, he is effectively called Twin Twin in the Gospels!

Jesus was probably illegitimate, as stated in the Talmud, and so brought up by Joseph of Arimathea, who would be his spiritual father; something Josephus reports was done by Essenes. The Essenes were reported to live like the Pythagoreans and Philo says there was a mixing of Greek Philosophy with Judaism at that time.

In 6 AD the Romans took over Judea and held a census in preparation for a tax on the population. At that time one of the most important leaders appeared, Judas the Galilean, who not only created, what Josephus calls, the ‘Fourth Philosophy’ of the Jews, but also tried to persuade people not to register. He became known as Chrestos, meaning the auspicious one. Josephus actually blamed the Galilean or his followers for the war against the Romans in 66 AD. Around 10 AD, Judas had one son, Simon and closer to 15 AD had a second, both were impaled by the Romans in 46 AD. Simon’s son, Eleazar, led the siege of Masada in 72 AD.

Around 22 AD Jesus underwent a ritual in the garden in Bethany, supervised by Arimathea and Nicodemus, which entailed being nailed to a cross, with a substantial footrest, as the nails were through the hands. It probably related to Naasene philosophy expressed in John 3:14 where Jesus equates himself to the snake and says “And as Moses lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must/so behoveth the Son of man be lifted up, that whoever believes in him, may have eternal life.’ One translation suggests a prediction, while the more accurate translation simply states it as a requirement. The philosophy of Jesus, appears to be most likely Naasene as there appears to incorporate Attis and Pythagorean ideas. The fourth century amulet showing a crucified man with the inscription, ORPHEOS BAKKIKOS, appears to be an example of a ritual crucifixion, and it appeared before any official image of Jesus on the cross, the first being a small door panel in St. Sabina in Rome in 420 AD, four hundred years after the event, and just after the Christian symbol of an X, the Chi Rho was changed to the upright cross. The *Pistis Sophia* states that Jesus was alive eleven years after his ritual crucifixion. The *Gospel of Philip* states, “Those who say that the Lord first died and then arose are mistaken, for he first arose and then died.

Eusebius writes, in his *Ecclesiastical History*, that there were people who said that Jesus was crucified before Pilate arrived in Judea: “For the things that they have dared to say concerning the passion of the Savior are put into the fourth consulship of Tiberius, which occurred in the seventh year of his reign; at which time it is plain that Pilate was not yet ruling in Judea, if the testimony of Josephus is to be believed, who clearly shows in the above mentioned work (*Antiquities*) that Pilate was made Procurator of Judea by Tiberius in the twelfth year of his reign.’ (22 AD)

Extraordinarily in Constantinople, this was added to the Nicaean creed in 381: “He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate.” Surely this is not a matter of faith, it is either a fact or not a fact? But it strongly suggests that people were not accepting it as fact, so that it had to added as a matter of faith, and anyone who did not accept it, was burnt at the stake. In fact the first Christian murdered as a heretic by the church was Priscillian, Bishop of Avila, just 4 years after Constantinople.

Jesus was taken down from the cross by Arimathea and then placed in the tomb, the same one Jesus would later use for the death and resurrection ritual of Lazarus. Antiseptic herbs were applied to the wounds as reported by John. There is every possibility that they performed a ritual equating Jesus with Attis, suggested by Matthew 19:12 to make Jesus semi angelic. In the mystery religions the initiate stays in the tomb for three days, as did Lazarus and Jesus, and when he came out he met Mary Magdalene who mistakes him for the gardener, and he says *Noli me tangere* (Do not touch me), which Josephus explains about the Essenes: ‘They are divided into four classes, according to their duration in the training, and the later-joiners are so inferior to the earlier-joiners that if they should touch them, the latter wash themselves off as if they have mingled with a foreigner.’

The attempt to down-play the importance of Mary Magdalene is why others were added to the first meeting with Jesus in the garden. And Paul totally cuts her from the first to see the risen Jesus. The attacks on the Magdalene were not because of a marriage but for reasons we will come to later.

The followers of Judas the Galilean were creating what Josephus calls a ‘turbulent period’. It appears that the Sicarii attacked anyone who collaborated with the Romans, and even burnt their homes and stole their cattle. In 26 AD the Romans brought in Pontius Pilate as a Procurator, rather than a governor, reflecting his military role, to try to quell the trouble. Around 29 AD Judas the Galilean had another son, Menahem who was to be a major player in the war of 66 at the age of 37.

In 32 AD Judas the Galilean and his warriors were about to attack Jerusalem, and kill Pilate, when they were betrayed by High Priest Joseph ben Caiaphas, and Pilate called out the whole garrison, which was a full Cohort and they killed the rebels and captured the Galilean. He was brought before Pilate and accused of not paying taxes and claiming to be King of the Jews. He was dressed as a king and humiliated by the guards before being scourged and impaled on a stake, which was the method of punishment reserved for slaves and rebels, not crucifixion. Pilate put a sign over his head, ‘King of the Jews’, which the High Priest was unhappy about. There is a remnant of the story in Slavonic Josephus, with poor attempts by Christians to switch it to Jesus. But it was so bad it was removed from our final versions of Josephus. It was between Pilate’s Standards incident and Pilate's Aqueduct disruption, II.174 and II.175 of Josephus' *War* book. This is the place in Josephus’ *Antiquities* where the fake *Testimonium* of Jesus appears. As Moslems did not destroy books, they had a lot of the information and the Qur’an suggests a substitute was killed by Pilate, a garbled version of the truth. And the *Gospel of Barnabas*, a Moslem influenced document has Pilate crucifying Judas Iscariot instead. As many believe Iscariot has its root in Sicarii, it seems that the person killed was Judas the Sicarii, which would be the Galilean.

In 34/35 AD after the death of Philip, his brother Herod Antipas married Philip’s wife Herodias. To do that he divorced his first wife, who was the daughter of King Aretas of Petra. John the Baptist complained about the marriage and was arrested and later beheaded, around the age of 50.

Herod’s first wife went home crying to her father, King Aretas and he raised an army and attacked Herod, and totally destroyed his army in 36 AD. Josephus reports that the population thought the destruction of Herod’s army was punishment from God for killing the Baptist. Herod complained to Emperor Tiberius and he asked Vitellius (who had sacked Pilate in 36 AD) to catch Aretas and bring him, or his head to Rome. Before he could set out Tiberius died on 16 March 37 AD. And Vitellius waited for instructions from Caligula. Vitellius brought a period of peace to Israel that, after the death of the Baptist, Jesus functioned in.

Jesus appeared to teach something close to Naasene beliefs, with, like them a respect for Pythagoras as he calls his movement “The Way.” Interestingly outside the Essene Gate in Jerusalem, is Mount Zion where the first mother Church was created by the Desposyni (Jesus relatives).

In 38 AD Jesus was arrested by Temple guards and taken to High Priest Theophilus ben Annas, tried as a blasphemer and a sorcerer and stoned to death. His body was then hung on a tree, as demanded in Deuteronomy, and buried before sunset. The correct translation of Acts 10:39 does appear to confirm this, as Jesus is killed first before he is hung on a tree. There are several other translations that give the game away, like Acts 5:30. Furthermore, it looks like Jesus’ stoning was in Josephus’ books. Early church father St. Jerome chooses to criticize Josephus for writing these three comments:

‘In the eighteenth Book of his Antiquities he (Josephus) most openly acknowledges that Christ was put to death by the Pharisees on account of his great miracles, that John the Baptist was truly a Prophet, and that Jerusalem was destroyed because of the murder of James the Apostle’

Jerome’s criticism seems to have succeeded in having these three comments removed from Josephus.

With Jesus birth in 7 BC and his death in 38 AD this would make the statement, “not yet fifty” more plausible.

Paul joins the movement led by Jesus brother, James but breaks away when he finds he can convert Gentiles with his own brand of religion, which involves raising the dead, which he even claims he can do himself. He adds elements, which appear to come from Mithras, like the Eucharist, to the Jesus story. Obviously the dipping bread at the Seder meal is not possible as there is no soft bread, and drinking wine representing blood, would disgust a Jew as they bleed all their meat, and glasses of wine serve a distinct symbol at the Seder.

Paul calls himself an Apostle and writes his own Gospel called the Gospel of Christ for the Gentiles, which he claims to have got from a visitation by Jesus, and calls anyone who does not accept it, including James the Just, and the other super Apostles, Satan’s men. (2 Cor. 11: and 13) Irenaeus writes, “Luke also, the companion of Paul, recorded in a book, the Gospel preached by him.” So it is Luke’s Gospel that is Paul’s Gospel of Christ. When in Rome, Paul and Luke, try to make the crucifixion a real event by confusing Jesus with Chrestos who was captured and killed by Pilate in 32 AD. Chrestos led the Nazarenes, (mentioned in Acts) as being troublemakers, who parted their hair in the middle and were fiercely anti Roman. Chrestos was Judas the Galilean, whose family used the same tactics against the Romans as the Maccabees used against the Greeks. He claimed to be a King, probably anointed by the Sadduc, who is named as his second in command, (and could be the Baptist.) And the Galilean’s son Menahem also acted as a king when Josephus says he entered the Temple carried by the Sicarii, after defeating the Romans in Masada.

Furthermore the age of Menahem when he beat the Romans at Masada, proves that his father Judas the Galilean could not have died in 6 AD as hinted at by the famous muddled verse in the Bible. But more importantly it appears impossible to think that Josephus did not write about the Galilean’s death, yet it is missing, for obvious reasons. And it is also obvious why Christian apologists try to suggest Josephus made a mistake calling Menahem the son of Judas as it gives away the truth about the Galilean’s death! After suggesting the Romans crucified Jesus Luke still had to blame the Jews – so they created the idea that Pilate washed his hands and wanted to release Jesus, but the Jews voted to release Jesus Barabbas, not Jesus the Messiah! To confuse Jesus with the Galilean, Jesus had to be associated with Galilee, had to be called a Nazarene, as if it is a person from a village called Nazareth, had to have Christos added to his name to confuse him with Chrestos; and the Church had to change the method of killing rebels by Romans to crucifixion when the correct translation is actually impaling. And they even had the Jews shouting in unison “Crucify Him!” Why this specific method of killing instead of “Chop his head off,” which was the normal method of capital punishment. No, this unison crowd even chant the disastrous words ‘His blood be on us and our children.” The church highlighted these details by emphasising selectively certain contradictions. For instance the church claims there is no question that Peter was a Galilean fisherman, and the Pope wears the Fisherman’s ring. Problem is this is flatly contradicted by John who makes it clear Simon Peter was a follower of the Baptist who lived at least 80 miles from the Sea of Galilee, in Judea. Most academics follow the church line with only the odd dissident like Professor Robert Eisenman, who writes:

‘A great deal of trouble is taken by these writers to get Jesus to Galilee.’ (Robert Eisenman: *Jesus and the Dead Sea Scrolls*)

He has no idea why, he just states a fact as he sees it as most of the references to Galilee are geographically and linguistically wrong.

The family from Bethany were clearly preaching the truth against the manufactured story in Rome, Lazarus in synagogues but Mary Magdalene as a woman could not, so all images of her teaching are in the open air. (See window in St Severin church in Paris)

Luke obviously hated these people who Jesus loved- “Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.” (John 11:5) so in his Gospel he refuses to mentions Lazarus and even refuses to admit that Jesus stayed the night in Bethany, even though all the other Gospels do. A problem arose when he had to get the donkey for Jesus to ride into Jerusalem, so while John says Jesus stayed the night in Bethany and then in the morning got on the donkey, Luke created a story where Jesus walks the 18 uphill miles from Jericho, and just happens to pass by Bethany, even adding another village, Bethphage to detract. And he says, Jesus does not enter Bethany even to tell the inhabitants that he will be back to stay that night, as all other Gospels admit, but simply asks his disciples to magically get the donkey. At this point the Bible is only the three synoptics – so the same unlikely story of the donkey, Luke inserts into Mark and Matthew. Then the church invented the invisible Q document to explain why all the Synoptic Gospels have, word for word, the same unlikely story, to move the Last Supper out of Bethany where it obviously took place, to an empty room in Jerusalem. The seder meal is a family affair, and requires a lot of preparation; you cannot just go to an empty room and hold it. The Gospels even have Martha complaining that Mary does not help her with ALL the preparations, suggesting the Seder preparations. Furthermore, in attempting to downgrade women and especially Mary Magdalene, the ‘Apostolic Church Order’ makes the huge mistake of admitting Mary and Martha were at the Last Supper, but Mary was castigated for laughing at the Eucharist idea. Quite rightly if you ask me.

The Bethany house and garden is said, during Templar initiation, “Obedience to Bethany the castle of Mary And Martha,’ to be quite palatial, so large to allow Jesus to banquet on sofas, as that explains how Mary can anoint his feet, while standing behind him, and Lazarus, the Beloved Disciple, can be leaning on Jesus’ bosom, while chatting to Peter, which is always so difficult to portray in paintings if they are on chairs.

After Luke’s death, or when he was old, John’s Gospel was added, and the edits of John are no longer around the Bethany family, so we get the inside story of Lazarus and the Magdalene. The inserts in John are now to separate Jesus from being a Jew by writing things like ‘Jesus and the disciple are in a room and the Jews are outside’. And they also inserted sections to John, that dealt with questions raised by critics – like - how did Jesus die so quickly? So a spear is added in John. And why did the Jews not stone Jesus themselves? – so they add a line that Jews are not allowed to stone blasphemers.

They were though presented with a problem, the Synoptics had said Joseph Ben Caiaphas was the High Priest who dealt with Jesus as he was the one who betrayed Judas the Galilean, and now, John states it was High Priest Theophilus ben Annas. So they edited out the first names of both High Priests as their names gave away the actual dates, and left us with High Priest Caiaphas, who was never High Priest and High Priest Annas who was just an old man. The church tried to invent a story, as to why there were two High Priest by suggesting that the old man was so influential that he was still called High Priest even though he was not. But Annas had five sons who became High Priests before and after Joseph, but he is never said to be ruling at the same time as them.

While there is primary source for most of this, the information of what happened to the Bethany family, so important to the Templars, has been destroyed. So we are left with tradition only. Around 43 AD, Mary Magdalene, Lazarus and Martha, travelled to the large Jewish community in Gaul. Blown off course they landed in the Camargue and the town was known as Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer. In the Languedoc they preached the true story of Jesus and his beliefs, which angered Luke who cut Lazarus out of the Bible, which was only the synoptics at the time. We only know of Lazarus when John was added. Luke also attacked the Magdalene calling the anointer a sinner and constantly down-playing her, which the church has continued. But Mary Magdalene was known and loved in the area as Notre Dame and many of the churches built during Templar times are dedicated to her, Notre Dame de Chartres with the Magdalene window, Notre Dame de Paris, with its *Noli me Tangere* sculpture, and whose Bishop Sully actually forbade the celebrations of the Virgins feast of the immaculate conception. So no fan of her. Notre Dame des Doms, each one claimed by the church to be dedicated to the Virgin mother. While they could succeed in that deception, it did not work for the landing place of Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer as that was only associated with the Magdalene. So in 1448 they removed Lazarus and Martha from the story. Added the same two Maries that were added to the Magdalene’s visit to the tomb, and changed the name of the town to the awkward Sainte-Maries-de-la-Mer. And if you go there now the statue in the church (which also had its name changed from Notre Dame-de-la-Mer) and the postcards have now only two Maries so now even the Magdalene is missing!

It is interesting that Templar events like the second crusade were begun on the Magdalene’s feast day, 22nd July and this was also the date that Nostradamus family converted from Judaism to Catholicism, taking the name of the Magdalene as there surname. Their boy was Christened Michael Nostredame, before taking on the name Nostradamus.

There are also many Templar churches to John the Baptist as there is a strong belief in the area that he was more important than Jesus, and this appears in esoteric circles like Leonardo’s paintings, and the Baptist feast day of 24th June is still held as the most important day in the Freemasons calendar.

As mentioned we only have tradition left of this journey as the church led a crusade against the area, murdering most of the population. This was followed by the Spanish Inquisition, which was mainly against converted Jews. And then, as the Jewish Encyclopaedia states, there was a censorship of all Jewish books trying to wipe out any vestige of the ideas. But the ideas went underground and appear in esoteric works especially people like Leonardo who was suspected of being a Rosicrucian. His *Virgin of the Rocks* shows the twins, but the church tried to suggest one is the Baptist, but if one is the Baptist then the other should be a babe in arms according to the church. And Leonardo knew the true age difference between the Baptist and Jesus which he reveals in his Burlington House Cartoon!

What you have read is not new, it is the original story of Jesus, known by early followers like the Ebionites (the Poor) who followed the Gospel of Matthew, which was known ‘among the Hebrews in their own dialect.’ Their beliefs are accidentally revealed by Bishop Eusebius:

‘For they considered Jesus a plain and common man, who was justified only because of his superior virtue and was the fruit of the intercourse of a man with Mary.’

So they did not believe Jesus was supernatural or born of a virgin. But if this is true, what is the nativity story with virgins and supernatural events, doing in present day Matthew? It clearly was not in the book they knew, in their own language?

But why does this original version of the Gospel story, differ from the one we know? It looks like Galatians 1:12 has the answer:

‘I want you to know, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.’

This is the Gospel that Luke copied and it is Luke who adapted the other synoptic Gospel to Paul’s fantasy.

These few pages are the bare bones of the theory, and it obviously was not plucked out of thin air, it comes from over 45 years of careful reading of the Gospels and Josephus, ignoring the consensus, which buys into the pick-and-mix story created by the Church, and ignores the contradictions which we try to explain.

Scholars who have come close: Dr. Robert Eisler (*The Messiah Jesus and John the Baptist*, 1931), Prof. Robert Eisenman (*James the Brother of Jesus*, 1997), and Edward Gibbon (*The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*, Ch. 15-16), who distinguishes "Galileans" as Judas the Galilean's zealots, not Christians, and notes Tacitus' potential confusion.
